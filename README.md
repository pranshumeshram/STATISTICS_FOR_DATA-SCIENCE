# STATISTICS_FOR_DATA-SCIENCE

Statistical and Probabilistic Approaches for Data Science using Python
This repository focuses on learning and applying statistical and probabilistic techniques to extract meaningful insights from data. Key topics include essential statistical concepts for data science, implemented using Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas. By exploring real-world examples, this project aims to build a solid foundation in both theory and practice for statistical analysis in data science.

Topics Covered
Descriptive Statistics: Summarize and describe data using measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
Inferential Statistics: Techniques to make predictions and infer insights from data samples, including hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.
Probability Theory: Fundamentals of probability, random variables, probability distributions, and their applications in data analysis.
Data Manipulation and Analysis: Using Pandas DataFrames for efficient data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and aggregation.
NumPy for Statistical Operations: Leveraging NumPy for fast numerical computations and array manipulations.
